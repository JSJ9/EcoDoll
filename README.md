Website creating during the Women in Computer Science Hackathon! This was worked with Sai Sriya and Helen Gordon. The goal of this website is to inform users how sustainable their shopping habits are. We decided to focus on a sustainability solution due to our team's values and providing a quick and impactful solution to informing our users of the impact they have in maintaining a sustainable lifestyle.
